Testing plan for C2J
====================

WORKING:
    Test C2J calls - just plain tasks - async calls.
    Even multiple C2J async calls are working.


    Sync C2J calls - returning values.

    Conditional execution:
    Test C2J async with jconditions
    Test C2J sync with jconditions


PROBLEMS:
    Large tasks are creating problems.. timeout.
    Also, disconnections and reconnections are not working for C2J sync tasks.
    This needs to be fixed.

    Test with occasional large task and small tasks again. Does the system
    heal??
